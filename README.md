# üîç Google Dork Generator

A Python tool that helps penetration testers and bug bounty hunters generate **Google Dork queries** for a given target domain.
It prints both the raw queries and clickable Google search URLs so you can directly open them in your browser.

---

## ‚ú® Features

* Auto-generates a list of **Google dorks** for a given domain.
* Includes both **basic** and **advanced dorks** (for sensitive files, backups, exposed keys, DB dumps, etc.).
* Prints queries in two formats:

  * Plain text queries (for copy-paste).
  * Direct Google search URLs (clickable links).
* Developer credit shown at the start (`@trashz403`).

Do you want me to also add a **section with example advanced dorks** (like `.git` leaks, exposed DBs, `.env` files, etc.) inside the README so contributors see the style and can add more easily?
